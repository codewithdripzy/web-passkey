# Passkey

**This library enables the use of passkey authentication for websites, incorporating various biometric and device-based authentication methods such as eye biometrics, facial recognition, pattern, connected device passkeys, and fingerprints.**

## Features

- **Fingerprints (PC & Mobile):** Authenticate using fingerprint sensors available on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Pattern (PC & Mobile):** Use pattern recognition, similar to what's used on some Android devices, for authentication.
- **Eye Biometrics (PC or Mobile that are supported):** Utilize eye scanning technology on supported devices for secure access.
- **Facial Recognition (PC & Mobile):** Implement facial recognition for user authentication on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Authenticator Apps (PC and Mobile):** Integrate with popular authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc., for generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
- **Connected Device Passkeys:** Allow authentication via passkeys stored on connected devices, such as smartwatches or other wearables.

## Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The user visits the website and is prompted to set up passkey authentication.
   - The user selects their preferred authentication method (fingerprint, pattern, eye biometrics, facial recognition, authenticator app, or connected device passkeys).

2. **Authentication:**
   - On subsequent visits, the user is prompted to authenticate using the chosen method.
   - If the device does not support the selected method, the user is prompted to scan a QR code with a supported device to complete the authentication.

3. **Fallback Mechanism:**
   - If no passkey methods are supported on the user's device, they can opt to use a connected device to scan a QR code for authentication.
   - Provide an alternative method such as email or SMS-based OTP for cases where biometric methods are not available.

### Additional Ideas

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Combine multiple methods for increased security. For example, require both fingerprint and facial recognition, or pattern and an authenticator app.

2. **Adaptive Authentication:**
   - Implement adaptive authentication that adjusts the required security level based on user behavior or location. For instance, request additional authentication factors if the user logs in from a new device or location.

3. **Biometric Data Encryption:**
   - Ensure that biometric data is encrypted and stored securely, complying with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

4. **Developer-Friendly APIs:**
   - Provide easy-to-use APIs and SDKs for integrating the Passkey library into various platforms and frameworks.

5. **Customizable UI:**
   - Allow developers to customize the authentication UI to match their website's branding and design.

6. **Support for Voice Recognition:**
   - Add support for voice recognition as another biometric authentication method.

7. **Offline Mode:**
   - Implement an offaon can still occur without an internet connection, using locally stored credentials and biometric data.

8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Ensure the library works seamlessly across different operating systems and browsers.

9. **User-Friendly Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive and user-friendly documentation to help developers implement and troubleshoot the library.

10. **Analytics Dashboard:**
    - Offer an analytics dashboard for admins to monitor authentication attempts, success rates, and potential security threats.

### Conclusion

The Passkey library aims to enhance website security by offering various biometric and device-based authentication methods. By expanding its features and implementing additional ideas, it can become a versatile and robust solution for modern authentication needs.
